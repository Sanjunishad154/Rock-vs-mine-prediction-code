# Rock-vs-mine-prediction-code
The Rock vs Mine prediction model uses sonar signal data to classify underwater objects as either rocks or sea mines. Itâ€™s trained on the UCI Sonar dataset using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression. With 60 input features, the model helps automate detection systems for defense, marine navigation, and robotic sonar applications.
